      I do theoretical physics. I always enjoying doing and learning math,
      although as a physicist I rarely work with those I'm not using presently
      (physicists are practical), unless it's fun enough. If things work out,
      I may end up being a professional physics worker (no matter what that
      means). I'm not opposed to work on things other than math and physics if
      I have to. Doing theoretical physics is literally like doing arts. All
      you need is a little bit of math and a lot of imaginations.

      I write <em>Chinese</em> poems (<a href="poems.html">here</a> are some recent ones).
      I climb on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      I write programs that simplify things for me, or just for fun
      occasionally. I enjoy working with lisp (guile for TeXmacs and elisp for
      emacs), julia (HPC lisp), mathematica (remote relative of lisp) and zig
      (the only nonlisp that I can suffer doing on a daily basis).
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm use emacs and TeXmacs most of time when I'm with my laptop (besides
      browsers of course :). I develop for TeXmacs at some of my spare time
      (mostly on lisp side, I rarely touch its cpp codebase).
    </p>
    <p>
      I use emacs org files to manage and tangle configurations of emacs
      itself, TeXmacs, my mailing system (basically msmtp, notmuch and mbsync,
      with some aid programs) and various lite configurations of my laptop.
      With emacs I rarely need to recall which file is stored within which
      directory. Emacs remembers everything for me. I also use a single org
      file to write weekly summary of my research, an email will composed out
      of each section and sent to my advisor after I finish it. I also use
      emacs to create and edit toc for PDF and DJVU files (books).

      TeXmacs is a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor that help you
      write math-heavy articles. It is developed by Joris van der Hoeven and
      others since the late 90s and it is <strong>NOT</strong> an interface to
      LaTeX. Writing things in TeXmacs is not only more fun, but make you stay
      focused. Not to mention that, just like emacs, one can easily manipulate
      TeXmacs via a lisp machine. BTW this website is written in TeXmacs. See
      <a href="https://www.texmacs.org">official site</a>, <a href="https://www.texmacs.org/joris/main/joris.html">Joris' blog</a>, <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:slowphil:texmacs-devel">slowpill

      I made <a href="https://github.com/hammerfunctor/tm-mathematica">tm-mathematica</a> (a mathematica plugin for TeXmacs),
      <a href="https://github.com/hammerfunctor/zdocscan">zdocscan</a> (used to make high-quality vectorized PDF or
      tiny-sized DJVU out of bad phone-taken photos). I also have a personal
      julia toolbox since college years that exploits mathematica as a
      symbolic package. The codes are dirty but quite effective when I need
      them. I don't have a plan to make it public, but feel free to email me
      if you wanna try it.
